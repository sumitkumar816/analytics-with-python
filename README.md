Titanic Survival Prediction : Data Analytics Project
Titanic
Python
SQL

📌 Overview :
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and SQL queries to uncover insights into passenger survival. The goal is to predict survival based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare using machine learning and data analytics techniques.

🔧 Technologies & Tools :
Python Libraries:

🐼 Pandas (Data Manipulation)

📊 Matplotlib/Seaborn (Visualization)

🔄 SQLite3/MySQL (Database Queries)

SQL (For data querying & analysis)

Jupyter Notebook (Interactive Analysis)

📊 Project Workflow :
1️⃣ Data Loading & Preprocessing (Python & SQL)
Load dataset using Pandas.

Handle missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked).

Feature engineering (extract Title from Name, create FamilySize).

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize survival rates by:

Gender (Sex)

Passenger class (Pclass)

Age groups

Fare ranges


Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

3️⃣ SQL-Based Analysis 
Run SQL queries for deeper insights:

Survival by family size

Average fare by class

Age distribution of survivors

📈 Key Findings :
Women and children had higher survival rates.

1st-class passengers were more likely to survive.

Family size impacted survival (small families had better chances)
